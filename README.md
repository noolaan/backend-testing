# backend-testing
An unfinished Node.js Express server to connect to roblox servers, essentially creating a backend server for roblox.
Would generally be used for server-synced mutes/kicks/bans, finding players in servers, server statistics, and much much more.

Was intended for implementation but never quite worked out.
